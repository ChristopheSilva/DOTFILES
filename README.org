Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system.  You can tell that a file is a dotfile because the name of the file will begin with a period--a dot!  The period at the beginning of a filename or directory name indicates that it is a hidden file or directory.  This repository contains my personal dotfiles.
